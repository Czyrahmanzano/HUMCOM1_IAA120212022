           <p>
            Your chosen Traveler (Aether or Lumine, we'll just go with the Traveler from now on) was locked in battle with a mysterious god-like figure in a world of pillars above the clouds.
            The god trapped your sibling in a mess of red cubes and then sent you hurtling to the ground in a new land called Teyvat, where you came across your new emergency food supply/guide Paimon. 
            You also gain the ability to control the element of Anemo (wind) after encountering a statue of one of the Seven Gods of Teyvat.

        <p>
          Paimon promises to help you find your sibling, and that's basically the overarching story for the entire game so far. But the pair's first step is to check with the ruling powers in Mondstadt, the nearby city, to see if anyone has seen the Traveler's sibling. So they head to talk to the Knights of Favonius, joined by their outrider Amber, your first party member.<br>
        The entire chapter in Mondstadt is mostly a tutorial in which you are introduced to combat and your other early party members; Kaeya, cavalry captain of the Knights of Favonius, and Lisa the librarian. They explain that a couple of things are threatening the peace of Mondstadt right now: a rampaging dragon known as Stormterror and a mysterious dark cult called The Abyss Order. Also some spies from the Northern region of Snezhnaya, called the Fatui, seem to be hanging around town a bit more

       <p>
        While investigating the dragon, you come across a bard known as Venti who is soothing the dragon's rage with song. He explains that the dragon was formerly known as Dvalin, one of the four winds that the god of wind (the Anemo Archon, Barbatos) entrusted to watch over Mondstadt. From analysing tears shed by the dragon, Venti discovers that Dvalin is slowly degrading and being corrupted by the Abyss Order, hence the rampage.<br>
        Venti reveals that he himself is the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, and that he wants to help his friend Dvalin. He enlists you to steal a holy lyre from the cathedral catacombs and uses it to purify the tears Dvalin sheds. The Abyss Order intervenes and Dvalin retreats to ruins to the North of Mondstadt known as Stormterror's Lair. These are the ruins of Old Mondstadt, during a time that the Anemo Archon ruled over the city as a tyrant, and Venti seems a little upset about these memories so asks you to go and save Dvalin for him.

          The next Archon we meet is the lord of Geo: Rex Lapis, or elsewhere known as Morax. He is associated with the region of Liyue and the region's focus on contracts and economy is a result of him overseeing all deals. Like a patron saint of lawyers. Arriving in the harbor city of Liyue, the Traveler learns that the annual Rite of Descension is about to begin, which summons Rex Lapis down to guide the city on how to conduct their affairs in the coming year.

          <p>
            Excitement over, they get round to having a funeral for Rex Lapis, despite it being clear it isn't actually the Archon himself as it's missing a Gnosis. To find out what happened to the Geo Archon, we look for Zhongli and find him having a chat with Signora and Childe. Apparently he's the Geo Archon and had orchestrated the entire affair with Signora to test Liyue to find out if they were ready to live without a god watching over them. Defending themselves from Osial with the help of the Adepti convinces him, and as part of a mysterious contract he had made with the Tsaritsa, he hands over his Gnosis. Just like that.<br>
            Right, we're two Archons down and no closer to finding our sibling. Zhongli tells us about the Electro Archon, Baal, who is currently keeping Inazuma under lock and key because they don't like people having Visions. Might be a bit difficult to get there but off we go.
